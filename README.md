# Derpiboo
An iOS app project for derpibooru.org written by an amateur programmer.


## What's this?
Just a random project of mine. We all love ponies but it's hard to view or search for pictures of them when we're on our phone. There is an Android app for Derpibooru (which is now defunct), but to my knowledge there isn't one for iOS. So here it is.

## What does it do?
It's a Derpibooru client. It basically pulls images from the site and display it with a nice UI in a native app.

### Currently it can:
* View the /images results. Basically the homepage of derpibooru
* Search for images. Use search terms the same way you would on the website
* Filter search results by different order. You can also filter them using the specific search terms
* View details of the image posts, including descriptions, tags and comments

### Planned features
* Login system. I'm looking into how to achieve this. 
* User's watch list
* Change active filters. This has to be tied with the login system since App Store requires some form of censorship with user-generated content. So something has to be done with filtering images that are not completely safe/vanilla.
* Parsing the texts in comments and in description
  
## But don't these apps get rejected from the stores?
I suppose so. Booru sites aren't exactly the most friendly towards copyrights and content filtering. I know the android version for derpibooru was rejected. I did submit this app to TestFlight a year ago and it got approved. It is a good sign, but it doesn't really mean much. Worst case scenario is that I will leave the code here for anyone to build onto their phones, but it requires the users to know how to do that. Another solution is to ditch login and set a strict filter to the images, though I'm not sure how much that'd help.

I can only know when I actually submit it for approval, but at the current state the app is not ready for submission yet.

## But it's buggy
I'm not the best programmer out there for iOS, and this is my learn-as-I-go project as well. I'd really appreciate feedback on how to improve the code.

## Information about the app
It requires iOS 9 or above, available for both iPhone and iPad.
